# SmartPlantMoisture
IoT/WoT Project of a Smart Plant Pot Moisture system with Raspberry PI

Pedro Costa has recently started his own apartment balcony pot garden with herbs and vegetables.
With a passion for techonology and Internet of Things, he decided to build up a plant pot automatic moisture system after being gifted with a brand new Raspiberry Pi 3 Model B by one of his best friends, Pedro Bettoni.

The intention is not to remain lazy and not manually moisture the plants, specially because he does enjoy doing it every morning. The main goal is instead to combine his computer science knowledge with his passion for innovation developing something that may be useful to others.

He would like to have the system setup for only one of this pots since, again, he does enjoy watering the plants everyday himself. He will keep the smart system setup for that pot for a while and compare the results with the exact same type of plant in another pot that does not have an automatic moisture system.
