# SmartPlantMoisture
IoT/WoT Project of a Smart Plant Pot Moisture system with Raspberry PI

Pedro Costa has recently started his own apartment balcony pot garden with herbs and vegetables.
With a passion for techonology and Internet of Things, he decided to build up a plant pot automatic moisture system after being gifted with a brand new Raspiberry Pi 3 Model B by one of his best friends, Pedro Bettoni, who's a also a passionate technology enthusiast with a great experience in building electronic components with RaspberryPI, Arduino, and much more.

Costa's intention is not to remain lazy and not manually moisture the plants, specially because he does enjoy doing it every morning. The main goal is instead to combine his and Bettoni's computer science knowledge with their passion for innovation developing something that may be useful to others.

They would like to have the system set up for only one of the pots since, again, Costa does enjoy watering the plants everyday himself. They will keep the smart system setup for that pot for a while and compare the results with the exact same type of plant in another pot that does not have an automatic moisture system.
